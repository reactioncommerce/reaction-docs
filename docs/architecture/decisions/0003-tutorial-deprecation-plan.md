# 3. Tutorial Deprecation Plan

Date: 2018-10-16

## Status

2018-10-16 proposed

## Context

As of the October 2018 preview release of Reaction 2.0, many of the tutorials and guides no longer are the recommended method for: installing and running Reaction, customizing the user interface of the storefront of Reaction, customizing the schema for GraphQL and more.

Readers need an easy way to find and distinguish between pre-2.0 and post-2.0 content. We want to reduce the number of broken links, and make sure people know that there is a more updated version of whatever document they are reading.

## Decision

## Use version 1.16 edition links for pre-2.0-specific content

- All pre-2.0-specific guides, for installing and customizing, will continue to live at version 1.6: https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/intro
    - Installation:
        - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/installation-osx
        - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/installation-windows
        - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/installation-linux
    - Tutorials:
        - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/creating-a-theme
        - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/how-to-create-a-custom-homepage
        - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/extending-product-schema-location-map
        - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/how-to-rtl
        - Swag Shop: 
            - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/swag-shop-tutorial
            - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/swag-shop-collecting-requirements
            - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/swag-shop-initialization
            - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/swag-shop-landing-page
            - https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/1.16.0/swag-shop-pdp
    - These are the links that should be used to link readers back to these versions.

## Use a single installation instruction link moving forward

- Use the Reaction Platform installation instructions across all READMEs: https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/installation-reaction-platform
    - Reaction
    - Example Storefront
    - With the exception of the Platform itself, which will need more in-depth instructions for those who also want to develop on the Platform.

## New process for deprecating a document

1. Remove document's ID from the current `sidebars.json`
2. In all previous versions of that document, add this note to the above links:
```> ⚠️ Note: This tutorial has been deprecated as the release of Reaction 2.0. The latest tutorial can be found at <insert link here>```
1. Search through the rest of the Docs, especially FAQs, to see if that now-deprecated document is linked anywhere. Update links and copy as appropriate.

## New process for deprecating associated repositories:

- If there are GitHub repositories associated with this document, like the Swag Shop's sample repo, that repository should be:
    1. Archived
    1. Have a similar deprecation note at the top of the README
- List of pre-2.0 repositories:
    - https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-swag-shop
    - https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-example-theme
    - https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-example-plugin
    - https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-main-street-theme
    - https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-styleguide

## New process for deprecating associated content:

1. Check YouTube video tutorials and update links in description if necessary
1. Check old Reaction Commerce blog posts that reference specific tutorials and update links in post if necessary

## Communicate the deprecation to the rest of the company:
1. Inform the rest of the company that the tutorial has been deprecated, in case people are sending links in emails, etc.

## Consequences

- In lieu of removing deprecated documents, we'll be increasing the total number of documents and links out there in the world.
