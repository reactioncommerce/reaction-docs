# Git style guide

Git version control is how we work together as a team. Naming branches and writing commit messages helps us keep a easy-to-understand history of the changes in the project.

## Naming Git branches

Create a branch name, with the ID number of the GitHub issue, in the following style:
`type-###-yourhandle-slug`. Example: `feat-123-impactmass-permissions`, `fix-222-spencern-shopify-hooks`

## Writing commit messages

Make atomic commits in the [Git commit message guidelines from Angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits), with a `(type):` followed by `subject`.

All of the types:

-   _feat_: A new feature
-   _fix_: A bug fix
-   _docs_: Documentation only changes
-   _style_: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
-   _refactor_: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   _perf_: A code change that improves performance
-   _test_: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
-   _chore_: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

Note the following styles:

-   Use the imperative, present tense: use "change", not "changed" nor "changes"
-   Do not capitalize first letter
-   No dot (.) at the end
-   Use `BREAKING CHANGES:` to note breaking changes

Examples:

    (feat): add sendEmail() job
    (docs): add doc for sendEmailJob() method
    (refactor): replace Blaze component with React component

    BREAKING CHANGES: remove Header Blaze template. To migrate to the React component, use HeaderComponent.

See more [examples from Angular.js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#heading=h.8sw072iehlhg).

## Making a pull request
