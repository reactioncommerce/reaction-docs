# Contributing Guide

At Reaction Commerce, we're dedicated to the open source community. In fact, we've designed our entire platform and business to grow from the passion and creativity that an open source community ignites. We've already attracted a small, dedicated team of open source contributors, and there's always room for more. If you'd like to join us, here's how to get started:

## Step 1: Get Reaction running

If you haven't already, get Reaction running locally:

```sh
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
git clone https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction.git
cd reaction
reaction
```

## Step 2: Finding an issue

Explore the interface and the code to give you a good overview of the product and a sense for what's already built. Keep an eye out for bugs and interface issues, as well as features you'd like to see created.

Check our our [`Good First Issue`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) and [`Help Wanted`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tags for good issues to tackle. If you find something you want to work on, let us know right there in the comments. If you are interested in a specific aspect of the project but aren't sure where to begin, feel free to ask.

Start small and open up a dialogue with us. This will help to get your contributions accepted easily.

## Step 3: The pull request and review process

[Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to propose and collaborate on changes to Reaction. These changes are proposed in a PR branch, and are reviewed before being merged into a `release-x.x.x` branch, and then released to `master`.

- PR should fill in all sections of the pull request
- Should reference an issue if one exists, or provide detailed information on the goal of the PR.
- Should pass CI / Tests. New functionality should include new tests.
- Should passing a linter code review and follow Reaction style guidelines.
- Code reviewed before merge acceptance.

### Pull request template

```md
Resolves #issueNumber
Impact: breaking|critical|major|minor
Type: feature|bugfix|performance|test|style|refactor|docs|chore

## Issue
Description of the issue this PR is solving, why it's happening, and how it can be reproduced. This may differ from the original ticket as you now have more information at your disposal.

## Solution

Summarize your solution to the problem. Please include short descriptions of any solutions you tested before arriving at your final solution. This will help reviewers know why you decided to solve this problem in this particular way and will speed up the review process.

## Breaking changes
If you have a breaking changes, list them here, otherwise list none.

Examples of breaking changes include changing file names, moving files, deleting files, renaming functions or exports, or changes to code which might cause previous versions of Reaction or third-party code not to work as expected.

Note any work that you did to mitigate the effect of any breaking changes such as creating migrations, deprecation warnings, etc.


## Testing
1. List the steps needed for testing your change in this section.
2. Assume that testers already know how to start the app, and do the basic setup tasks.
3. Be detailed enough that someone can work through it without being too granular
```

### Additional details for pull request authors

#### Top section

##### Resolution

The first line of every PR should have `Resolves #ticketNumber`.

If this PR is fixing an unreported bug, the first line should read: `Resolves unreported issue`.

We do not accept PRs to add functionality without an issue.

##### Impact

The second line of every PR should have `Impact breaking|critical|major|minor`.

The impact of a PR will help us determine what kind of release it belongs in, and how urgent the review needs to be. E.g. a `critical` bugfix would be a PR that fixes a bug in the core ecommerce flow (browse products, view PDP, add to cart, any checkout step).
- `breaking` - introduces breaking changes to the app.
- `critical` - resolves a `critical` bug blocking core functionality. Examples include browsing products, adding products to cart, checking out, processing orders, etc.
- `major` - resolves a `major` bug or introduces significant new feature.
- `minor` - resolves a `minor` bug, minor changes to the app, or minor new feature

##### Type

The third line of every PR should have `Type: feature|bugfix|performance|test|style|refactor|docs|chore`

We define each type in the following way:
- feature: A new feature or functionality
- bugfix: A bug fix
- performance: A code change that improves performance
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- docs: Documentation only changes
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

#### Issue Description

Describe the issue this PR is solving with the knowledge you've gained by fixing it. This may differ from the original ticket as you now have more information at your disposal. A great PR will include additional information gathered during the process of resolving the ticket that might be helpful to reviewers or other users who might encounter the same problem.

Please include _all_ information necessary to understand the issue this PR resolves so that the reviewer does not need to look at the original ticket.

#### Solution

Summarize your solution to the problem. Please include short descriptions of any solutions you tested before arriving at your final solution. This will help reviewers know why you decided to solve this problem in this particular way and will speed up the review process.

If you have introduced any new dependencies, please list them, explain how they are used in your solution and any other libs that you considered.

#### Breaking Changes

If you have a breaking changes, list them here, otherwise list none.

Examples of breaking changes include changing file names, moving files, deleting files, renaming functions or exports, or changes to code which might cause previous versions of Reaction or third-party code not to work as expected.

Note any work that you did to mitigate the effect of any breaking changes such as creating migrations, deprecation warnings, etc.

#### Testing Instructions

Write instructions for testing your changes. You can assume that reviewers know how to start the app and how to perform basic setup tasks. For any task where there may be multiple ways to do something, be explicit. (e.g. there are several ways to "Create a Product" and many options once created before a product is published).

The steps you list should guide the reviewer through testing the feature or fix you've implemented. These steps will generally be very similar to the reproduction steps in the issue.

### Additional details for pull request reviewers

#### Top Section
Read over the original ticket and determine the impact this PR will have on the codebase. If the PR doesn't follow the our template, reject and point the author of the PR to this doc.

#### Issue Description
Use this information as the starting point for your review. If something is not clear, reject the PR and ask for clarity by requesting changes. While the original issue may have useful information, the PR should contain the most up to date representation of the issue.

#### Solution

Use this information to help determine a path to test this PR. Research any included packages or techniques that may have been used that you're not familiar with. Ask questions if you're confused.

#### Breaking changes

Test by applying this patch to an existing install of Reaction with existing users, orders, carts, etc. Specifically, test any parts of the app where the breaking change is involved and any data set that is involved in a migration.

#### Testing

Run through the author's steps to verify that it works as they've tested it. Then run through the app on your own as you would test it. Run through the app as many times as you feel comfortable before approving or requesting changes.

#### Code Review

Review the code changes that this PR makes. Note any changes that you'll want to QA in the app, even if they aren't listed in the testing steps (e.g if the code changes a `cart` button, ensure that the button still works).

Code should be vetted for:

- Readability: the linter will help with this, but call out anything that is difficult to understand or that you feel needs comments
- Documentation: all code added or touched should have proper JSDoc, any new functionality should be documented.
- Security: Code should only be usable by users with the correct roles. Any data published should be filtered to ensure that only users with the correct roles for the correct shops have access to it.
- Performance: Code should be written with performance in mind. Data publications should only publish data necessary to accomplish the specific goal at hand.
- Tests: Any new functionality should include tests
- Dependencies: Any newly introduced dependencies should be updated to the latest version. No Meteor dependencies.
- i18n: All static copy should use i18next. Include definitions in the appropriate `en.json` file.
- a11y: Code should be a11y compliant.

### Here's what to expect when you make a pull request to Reaction

As soon as pull requests are pushed, automated test are run to ensure:

- All linting rules pass without errors or ignores.
- Dependencies are not failing.
- All tests pass.
- No new security vulnerabilities are introduced.

You can run these checks yourself by running these commands:

- `npm run lint` for linting
- `reaction test` for all tests

### Community team pull request review

The Community team triages all new pull requests as soon as possible. The team reviews code quality rules including:

- No new Atmosphere or Meteor dependencies are introduced.
- No hard-coded copy: All copy and alerts should have i18n keys and values.
- Updated LingoHub translations.
- All new methods and files have JSDoc summaries, as outlined in [JSDoc Style Guide](/developer/jsdoc-style-guide.md).
- All folders, variables, method names follow naming conventions, outlined in [Reaction Code Style Guide](/developer/styleguide.md).

The team also encourages in-line commenting.

Use comments to:

- Explain functionality to someone new to the code
- Link to any external documentation

### Getting feedback early and often

Want to get feedback on your pull request before it's ready for merging?

Push up the branch and add `[WIP]` for Work in Progress to the title and ask a question in GitHub.

## Step 4: Congrats! It's approved and merged. What's next?

Once a pull request goes through both the automated and Core team reviews, it's ready to be merged. Here are some things you may want to consider after that:

- If your pull request referenced an issue, close that issue.
- Does your new feature require new user documentation or developer documentation? Make an issue for that in [reaction-docs](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-docs/issues).
