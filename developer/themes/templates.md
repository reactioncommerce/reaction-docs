# Templates

Reaction Templates are primarily Blaze Templates, but Meteor supports React and other templating libraries.

To learn more about Meteor, Spacebars, and Blaze templates: <http://blazejs.org/guide/introduction.html>

## Extending templates

Reaction includes the [meteor-template-extension](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-template-extension) package which provides functionality for extending Meteor templates.

To extend and customize the html for any reaction/meteor template, add a template extension map to `client/templates.js`

```js
// extending core with template extensions
Template.my_custom_template.replaces("core_template_name");
```

then create a template (probably a copy of the one you are extending).

```handlebars
<template name="my_custom_template">
  <h1>This will be used instead of the core template!</h1>
</template>
```

While you can always organize your templates however you wish, [we suggest](/developer/styleguide.md) you mirror the existing structure. For example, if you are extending the template located in `reaction/imports/plugins/included/product-variant/client/templates/products/products.html` then you would mirror that by creating your new template at `reaction/client/templates/products/myTemplate.html`

_The template helpers, events, etc. from the original are still accessible and used in the new extended template._
