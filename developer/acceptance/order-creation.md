# Order Creation

## Description
Test to verify the following functionality:
 - The user can access the product detail page from the product grid.
 - The user can select a product variant and add it to the cart.
 - The user can complete the checkout process.
 - The user can make a payment.
 - The user receives order confirmation screen and order confirmation email.

**Touch Points**
 - Test must be completed two consecutive times to be considered passing.
 - Test must be completed using all three **user type** variants to be considered passing.
 - PayPal Express needs a personal sandbox account to test. See the [PayPal documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/lifecycle/sb_about-accounts/#create-a-personal-sandbox-account) for more information.

## Intended Outcome
 - The user will receive a confirmation screen, displaying the order ID, the user’s email address, items ordered, shipping address, payment method and order total summary.
