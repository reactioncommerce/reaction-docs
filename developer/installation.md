[![Installation Video](/assets/guide-installation-video-screenshot.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkFDX8NWskY)

Review and install the [Reaction requirements.](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/master/requirements).

To install and run Reaction locally in development mode:

```sh
# install CLI
npm install -g reaction-cli

# clone Reaction, install NPM dependencies
reaction init

# move into the new app directory
cd reaction
```

## reaction

To start Reaction, run the `reaction` command

```sh
# start Reaction
reaction
# or
reaction run
```

_The initial admin user for the site is auto generated, and displayed in your console (or see: env variables section to default these)_

Sample data is loaded on a new installation from `private/data`. This can take some time depending on your system.

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) and you should see Reaction running.

To terminate `reaction` use `CTRL-c`.

The `reaction` command line also accepts [Meteor command line options](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/meteorhelp).

`reaction` appends some commands to the default `meteor` command, it adds `--raw-logs` and uses the `settings/dev.settings.json` configuration by default. If you create a `settings/settings.json` it will use this file instead of the default.

### reaction --help

`reaction -h` will give you help for the `reaction` command.

```sh
reaction -h
reaction <command> [options]

You could just use `git pull`, but `reaction pull` will update npm modules and other dependencies.

This will give you a fresh test dataset from `private/data`.

```sh
reaction reset
```
