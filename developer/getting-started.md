# Getting Started with Reaction

Reaction uses Meteor as a build tool and development environment. Meteor eases Reaction's use of ES6, npm packages, services, and React by providing additional glue for the integration and deployment of these components.

- [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/developers)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/how-npm-works/packages)
- [Less](http://guide.meteor.com/build-tool.html#less)
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html)

## Customization Guide

Looking to customize your store? Check out our [customization guide](/developer/tutorial/customization.md) for a walkthrough, as well as examples on how to create your own custom packages.

## Local Plugins

A number of plugin modules are imported in the `reaction` local `/imports/plugins` folder. We will refer to these local packages as "Core" packages, or as local plugin modules.

There are many Reaction plugins included. The current `imports` folder contains core, included, and a folder for custom plugins.

### Packages

The preferred method of extending Reaction functionality is to use local import plugins or [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages.

Reaction is also able to install Meteor packages from [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/), Meteor's legacy package registry.

To further customize your experience, you can create or use community packages from npm and Atmosphere. For more info, [click here](https://guide.meteor.com/atmosphere-vs-npm.html).
