## Architecture

### What about SEO?

Since 2014 [Google has indexed JavaScript when crawling websites](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html). Reaction, however, offers page pre-rendering and product detail page metatag generation out of the box to ensure products are indexed well for web crawlers and search engines:

1. [Prerender.io](https://prerender.io/): Reaction includes integration with Prerender.io out of the box. Prerender.io is a commercial service that will generate static renderings of the application for search engines. ALl you have to do is provide a key to your site and Prerender will handle the pre-rendering.

2. [Spiderable](https://github.com/ongoworks/spiderable): A now-deprecated solution is our Atmosphere package called (Spiderable)[https://atmospherejs.com/ongoworks/spiderable] that pre-renders Meteor applications for search engines.

3. [meteor-dochead](https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-dochead): Automatically add `<meta>` tags are for products using the [meteor-dochead](https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-dochead) package which uses the title, description and `details` fields of the product to render SEO-friendly data. You may need to use a tool like [SEO Inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seo-inspector/iejckekdjogeeilmllnabmgkbbmedeal?hl=en) to see this data.
