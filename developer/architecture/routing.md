# Routing
Reaction implements the routing functionality provided by [kadira:flow-router-ssr](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/tree/ssr) for routing in the `reaction-router` package.  

> More Flow Router documentation is on the [kadirahq/flow-router GitHub repository](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router).

The Reaction Flow Router instance is exported as `ReactionRouter`

## Defining Registry Routes

To future proof against changes to the router, the recommended approach is to define an entry in the **Package Registry**, but you can also use `ReactionRouter.route()` to define routes.

Routes are very simple and based on the syntax of [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) which is used in both [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and `iron:router`.

The **Reaction package registry** entries define routes that can be used with the Flow Router API. 

```js
  registry: [{
    route: "/product/:handle/:variantId?",
    name: "product",
    template: "productDetail",
    workflow: "coreProductWorkflow"
  }]
```

You can also pass local functions to the registry.  

### Route Table 
The package registry route entries are collectively added to the Flow Router routing table upon startup. 

To view the client routing table

```js
console.table(ReactionRouter._routesMap);
```
or all defined routes

```js
console.table(ReactionRouter._routes);
```

## API

The [Flow Router API](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router#api) that ReactionRouter implements is a rich API to help you to navigate the router and reactively get information from the router.

#### ReactionRouter.getParam(paramName);

Reactive function which you can use to get a parameter from the URL.

```js
// route def: /apps/:appId
// url: /apps/this-is-my-app

const appId = ReactionRouter.getParam("appId");
console.log(appId); // prints "this-is-my-app"
```

#### ReactionRouter.getQueryParam(queryStringKey);

Reactive function which you can use to get a value from the queryString.

```js
// route def: /apps/:appId
// url: /apps/this-is-my-app?show=yes&color=red

const color = ReactionRouter.getQueryParam("color");
console.log(color); // prints "red"
```

#### ReactionRouter.path(pathDef, params, queryParams)

Generate a path from a path definition. Both `params` and `queryParams` are optional.

Special characters in `params` and `queryParams` will be URL encoded.

```js
const pathDef = "/blog/:cat/:id";
const params = {cat: "met eor", id: "abc"};
const queryParams = {show: "y+e=s", color: "black"};

const path = ReactionRouter.path(pathDef, params, queryParams);
console.log(path); // prints "/blog/met%20eor/abc?show=y%2Be%3Ds&color=black"
```

If there are no params or queryParams, this will simply return the pathDef as it is.

##### Using Route name instead of the pathDef

You can also use the route's name instead of the pathDef. Then, ReactionRouter will pick the pathDef from the given route. See the following example:

```js
ReactionRouter.route("/blog/:cat/:id", {
    name: "blogPostRoute",
    action: function(params) {
        //...
    }
})

const params = {cat: "meteor", id: "abc"};
const queryParams = {show: "yes", color: "black"};

const path = ReactionRouter.path("blogPostRoute", params, queryParams);
console.log(path); // prints "/blog/meteor/abc?show=yes&color=black"
```

#### ReactionRouter.go(pathDef, params, queryParams);

This will get the path via `ReactionRouter.path` based on the arguments and re-route to that path.

You can call `ReactionRouter.go` like this as well:

```js
ReactionRouter.go("/blog");
```


#### ReactionRouter.url(pathDef, params, queryParams)

Just like `ReactionRouter.path`, but gives the absolute url. (Uses `Meteor.absoluteUrl` behind the scenes.)

#### ReactionRouter.setParams(newParams)

This will change the current params with the newParams and re-route to the new path.

```js
// route def: /apps/:appId
// url: /apps/this-is-my-app?show=yes&color=red

ReactionRouter.setParams({appId: "new-id"});
// Then the user will be redirected to the following path
//      /apps/new-id?show=yes&color=red
```

#### ReactionRouter.setQueryParams(newQueryParams)

Just like `ReactionRouter.setParams`, but for queryString params.

To remove a query param set it to `null` like below:

```js
ReactionRouter.setQueryParams({paramToRemove: null});
```

#### ReactionRouter.getRouteName()

To get the name of the route reactively.

```js
Tracker.autorun(function() {
  const routeName = ReactionRouter.getRouteName();
  console.log("Current route name is: ", routeName);
});
```

#### ReactionRouter.current()

Get the current state of the router. **This API is not reactive**.
If you need to watch the changes in the path simply use `ReactionRouter.watchPathChange()`.

This gives an object like this:

```js
// route def: /apps/:appId
// url: /apps/this-is-my-app?show=yes&color=red

const current = ReactionRouter.current();
console.log(current);

// prints following object
// {
//     path: "/apps/this-is-my-app?show=yes&color=red",
//     params: {appId: "this-is-my-app"},
//     queryParams: {show: "yes", color: "red"}
//     route: {pathDef: "/apps/:appId", name: "name-of-the-route"}
// }
```

### pathFor helper
A Blaze template helper that returns the path for a route name and accepts params.


```js
<template name="">
	{{pathFor 'product' handle=product.handle variantId=variants._id}}
</template>
```
