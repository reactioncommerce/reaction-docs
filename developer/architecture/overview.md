# Architecture

## What is Reaction?

Reaction is a modern reactive, real-time event driven ecommerce application.

Reaction is built with JavaScript (ES6), Meteor, Node.js and works nicely with Docker.

Reaction contains application code that uses a modular plugin design allowing for custom plugins or **npm** modules that can be used to easily be customize and add new functionality.  Reaction can use both Atmosphere packages or **npm** modules.

The modular nature of Reaction also allows for it to also be used to provide micro services when accessed using the DDP protocol.

## What is Meteor?

Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications. Meteor includes a key set of technologies for building connected-client reactive applications, a build tool, and a curated set of packages from the Node.js and general JavaScript community.

- Meteor allows you to develop in one language, JavaScript, in all environments: application server, web browser, and mobile device.
- Meteor uses data on the wire, meaning the server sends data, not HTML, and the client renders it.
- Meteor embraces the ecosystem, bringing the best parts of the extremely active JavaScript community to you in a careful and considered way.
- Meteor provides full stack reactivity, allowing your UI to seamlessly reflect the true state of the world with minimal development effort.
