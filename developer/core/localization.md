# Localization

## Currency Localization

Currency formatting is determined by users locale currency. The currency formatting is stored in the `Shops.currencies` object, and the configuration data is available in the client as `Reaction.Locale`. There are 2 important objects here:

-   `currency` - contains data about user's currency;
-   `shopCurrency` - contains data about base shop currency.

We've created `formatPrice` and `currencySymbol` helpers for using in templates:

```handlebars
{{formatPrice price}}
```

We use the [accounting.js](https://openexchangerates.github.io/accounting.js/) library for formatting.

Typical usage is `price = accounting.formatMoney price, Reaction.Locale.currency`

_Note: changing base shop currency is not reactive. Refresh/restart to see changes._

To add a currency you can add an entry in `reaction-sample-data/private/data/Shops.json`. For example:

```json
"currencies" [
  "PHP": {
    "format": "%s %v",
    "symbol": "PHP"
  }
]
```

_Please note that the currency must be supported by Open Exchange Rates service to get automatic conversion for a user's locale._

### where

In some currencies it is more natural to display only one currency symbol in price range (_"100 - 120 руб."_ instead of _"100 руб. - 120 руб."_).

You can add optional field `where` to force usage of only one sign and specify on which side of range the symbol should be placed. Currently only `right` value is supported.

```json
...
"currencies" [
  "RUB": {
    "format": "%v %s",
    ...
    "where": "right"
  }
]
...
```

## locateAddress

The locateAddress method determines a user's street address based on latitude and longitude coordinates or by ip address.

Usage:

```js
Meteor.call("locateAddress", latitude, longitude, (address) => {
  # do something on callback
});
```

locateAddress takes latitude and longitude in [decimal degree format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees) and uses a reverse geolocation lookup to determine street address. If coordinates are not provided, the method attempts to use the user's ip address to determine general location. An address is returned in this format:

```js
[{
  latitude: Number,
  longitude: Number,
  country: String,
  city: String,
  state: String,
  stateCode: String,
  zipcode: String,
  streetName: String,
  streetNumber: String,
  countryCode: String
}]
```

If no address can be found, then the following address object is returned:

```js
[{
  latitude: null,
  longitude: null,
  country: "United States",
  city: null,
  state: null,
  stateCode: null,
  zipcode: null,
  streetName: null,
  streetNumber: null,
  countryCode: "US"
}]
```
