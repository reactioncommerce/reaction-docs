## Order Methods

The core plugin module `imports/plugins/core/orders` contains all order related Meteor methods.

### orders/inventoryAdjust

```js
import { Products } from "/lib/collections";

Products.update({
  "_id": product.productId,
  "variants._id": product.variants._id
}, {
  $inc: {
    "variants.$.inventoryQuantity": -product.quantity
  }
});
```

  event: event,
  value: value,
  userId: Meteor.userId(),
