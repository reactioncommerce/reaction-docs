# Shipping

Partial implementation, please review current Github Issues.

The included plugin `imports/plugins/included/shipping` provides a shipping module structure.

Currently `reaction-shipping` only provides flat-rate per order rules. All other rules will be added, and contributions are welcome.

The Schema and collections are setup to support the following rules, which need to be written.

## Methods

- **flat rate - per order**
- flat rate - line item
- flat rate - order value over/under
- carrier - line item calculated / weight
- carrier - bundled box, dimensions + weight
- percentage - line item
- percentage - order value

## Usages Scenarios

- bundled box dimensions + weight
- different originations
- different destinations
- destination fees (example: charge more for international)
- flat rate
- mixed carrier rates
- mixed carrier per line item (one flat rate+ one calculated)
- per vendor
- per vendor + method

## Shop results

- Rates, per order, per line:
- available (carrier / method title / rate)
- Estimated Delivery Dates
- Estimate Shipping Dates

## Order Results

- Tracking Code
- Label PDF
- Customs Documents
