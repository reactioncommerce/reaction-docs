# Community

Welcome to the Reaction community!

This is the starting point for becoming a contributor - improving docs, improving code, and giving talks.

Participating in our Gitter channels and our planning meetings are welcome contributions to Reaction.

If you'd like to contribute code and issues, you'll want to review the [contribution guidelines](contributing.md).

## Roadmap

Reaction is a series of projects that combine the efforts of [community contributors](https://github.com/orgs/reactioncommerce/outside-collaborators) and core product development from the [@reactioncommerce](https://github.com/orgs/reactioncommerce/people) team.

A long-term roadmap and completed features list is on our [features page](https://reactioncommerce.com/features).

You will find these roadmap items defined as projects on the [Reaction repository's project page](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/projects).

Specific features in progress are found grouped on the [Reaction repository's milestones page](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/milestones).

## Projects

Reaction projects can have both @core leads as well as community leads.
Chat channels and meetings are open to all. Here's our [Reaction Community Google Calendar](http://getrxn.io/2rcCal) with all of the meetings and Reaction Action events.
