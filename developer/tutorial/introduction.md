# Customizing Reaction Commerce with Themes and Plugins

## Purpose

This tutorial is in two parts, the first parts focuses on creating a custom "theme" which is how you can modify
the appearance of Reaction without changing any of the original files. The second part deals with creating a custom
"plugin" which allows you extend the functionality or create completely new functionality.

### What's the difference between a theme and plugin?

In terms of layout structure how Meteor sees them, nothing. Themes are just a subset of plugins that only focus on
modifying the appearance and UX of Reaction. 

### Can I combine appearance and backend changes?

Yes, plugins can do everything a theme can do.

### Where do I start?

This depends on what you want to do. If you want to largely change the look and feel of the application and not the way
it functions you will want to read the themeing tutorial. If you want to change functionality like add new routes
you will want to read the plugin tutorial. If you want to do both, well then you need to read both.
