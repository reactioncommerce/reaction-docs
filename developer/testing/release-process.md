# Release process

The [Reaction engineering team and invited community collaborators](https://github.com/orgs/reactioncommerce/people) creates new release branches of Reaction.

The process is:
1. Create a release branch, but not until you ready to release!
1. Change destination branch from master to release branch for all PR that should be included.
1. Wait until all tests have passed on each PR.
1. Merge passing PR's into the release branch.
1. Create a new `Release x.x.x` pull request.
1. Create release notes and docs
1. Release review, test pass, be brave.
1. Merge to `master`, wait for tests, then tag release.
1. After successful merge, delete the release branch.

## Release branch

1. Create a branch from `master` named **release-x.x.x**
2. Commit incremented `package.json` version
3.  run `meteor npm install` to bump `package-lock.json` version
4.  Should ~follow [SemVer](http://semver.org/) guidelines:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Accept pull requests and i18n

- Merge approved patches/fixes/features pull requests for this release into the `release-x.x.x` branch.
- Create [LingoHub Pull Request](https://translate.lingohub.com/reaction-commerce/dashboard) if  i18n translations need updating in the release branch. LingoHub will automatically create files that are missing for all languages when only a `en.json` is provided, so a review of _i18n imports_ should also be performed before merging the i18n translation PR into the release branch.
- run `meteor npm install` as well as `reaction run` to make sure that all `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files get updated.
- Create a new pull request, with title `Release x.x.x` from the `release-x.x.x` branch to `master`.

## Release notes

- Create release notes - a summary of all PR and notable changes in the release.
- Run the following from the directory of the repo you are releasing:

```sh
git log <firstCommitHash>..<lastCommitHash> | pcregrep -A 2 -M 'Merge pull request' | perl -pe 's/Merge.*(#[0-9]{4}).*/$1/' | perl -pe 's/^(\-|#| |(\[[a-zA-Z]+\])+|\n)*//g' | perl -0777pe 's/([0-9]{4})\n(.+)\n/ - $2 (#$1)\n/g'
```

- Write extended notes about anything that is a breaking change or potentially breaking change.
- Write extended notes about anything that is interesting, adds exciting new functionality, or improves the app significantly in some way

Notes:

- You'll need `pcregrep` on your system which you can install on osx with brew `brew install pcre`
- Replace `<firstCommitHash>` and `<lastCommitHash>` with the first and last commit or tag of the release respectively. You can use prev tag and `HEAD` for this if you have the release branch checked out. e.g. `git log v1.5.5..HEAD | ...`
- Copy release notes to PR

## Release docs

- Merge outstanding documentation pull requests.
- Tag and release reaction-docs for major versions.

## Release review

- All Automated checks MUST PASS - even for admins.
- Scores should always be 90+, no vulnerabilities.
- Request two release reviewers to approve the PR.
- Neither reviewer can be the person who submitted the PR.
- Release on approval.

## Release

- **Merge** the `Release x.x.x` pull request into `master`
- Allow all tests and builds to complete
- [Draft and publish a new GitHub Release](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/releases)
- Wait for all `master` tests to pass.
- Follow the format of previous release, copy change log from release PR into the release notes.

## Cleanup

- Review issues that the release resolves, that they are closed and stale branches removed.
