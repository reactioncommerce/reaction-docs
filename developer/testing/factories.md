# Factories

The [reaction-factories](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-factories) package supplies `Factory` and `faker` with additional methods for testing Reaction packages.

## Factory

The following factories are predefined:

- `cart` creates cart with 2 items

- `cartToOrder` creates cart with `workflow.status: checkoutPayment`. It is ready for order testing

- `anonymousCart` creates cart attached to anonymous user

- `order`

- `authorizedApprovedPaypalOrder` defines order factory which generates an authorized, apporved, paypal order

- `shop` creates shop. But we recommend to use `faker` for shop creation

- `user` creates user without `roles`

- `registeredUser` creates normal user with an additional `account/profile` role to the default `roles` list.

- `anonymous` creates anonymous user with an additional `anonymous` role to the default `roles` list.

- following 2 factories are used internally and not used directly for creation of full product. We don't recommend use them for tests (check `faker` instead):

  - `variant` creates item with `type = variant`
  - `product` creates empty product without variants
