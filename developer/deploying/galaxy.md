# Meteor

Free development hosting from [Meteor](http://guide.meteor.com/deployment.html#free-hosting) Development Group.

Deploying to Meteor.com with a developer account:

```sh
meteor deploy --settings settings/<prod-settings>.json <yoursite>.meteor.com

 A great service for sharing pre-production prototypes, but doesn't include `imagemagick`.
