## Permission Groups

Permission Groups are are way to grant multiple users a group of permissions. The Accounts Dashboard provides a way to create a group and add users to them.
Reaction currently ships with the four groups: Guest, Customer, Shop Manager and Owner. The Shop Manager and Owner groups are admin groups.
Guest group is by default for anonymous (un-registered) users while Customer group is by default for registered users (users who created accounts).
