title: What is GraphQL?
---

GraphQL is a query language that allows clients to make requests with POSTs over HTTP to a single URL. Those requests can indicate exactly which data they need back, and all data is sent back in the response. Both client and server are aware of a strongly typed shared schema, so data validation is automatic.

Before going much further in learning about Reactionâ€™s GraphQL implementation, you should be sure to thoroughly read and understand the materials at https://graphql.org/learn/.
