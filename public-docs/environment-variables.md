Reaction Commerce is a system made up of various services and web servers, each of which is distributed as a Docker image, or can be customized and then built into your own Docker image. Container-based microservice deployments typically get much of their configuration from environment variables, and Reaction is no exception. Some environment variables are required because they tell a container service how to connect to another service or a database. Others are optional with sensible defaults, but allow you to customize the system to meet your needs.

This article aims to be a full listing of the required and optional environment variables used by all components of the Reaction Commerce system. If you discover any missing variables, please submit a pull request to update this article.

| `SESSION_MAX_AGE_MS`                    | The maximum age in milliseconds for the storefront session cookie, which is used for authentication. Note that Hydra also tracks an authentication session with its own cookie, so setting this lower than the Hydra cookie lifetime will likely result in users being silently logged back in if they are still "logged in" to Hydra. For this reason, it is less confusing if you set this to match the `HYDRA_SESSION_LIFESPAN` variable on Reaction Identity service, keeping in mind that `HYDRA_SESSION_LIFESPAN` is in seconds rather than milliseconds. | Default is 24 hours. Override in `.env` as needed.                                           | Default is 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
