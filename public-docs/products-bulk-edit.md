Products can be filtered and selected so that admin users can apply bulk actions on them.

## Filtering products by CSV

Users can filter a large list of products by ID:

1. Create a CSV file with a comma-separated list of product IDs you'd like to filter. Here's what an example CSV file with three IDs looks like:
```
NMBfxaXY7XDz6yTCa,ZkQp6YffdXbEp4Xgj,cR6LKN5yGSiei7cia
```
1. Go to the Products listing page and click **Filter by File** in the **Actions** menu.
1. Click **Import** and choose the CSV file(s) you'd like to use.
1. Click **Filter products**.
1. You should see all of the products with IDs listed in the CSV files below. You may now uncheck any products if you need to exclude any.


## Bulk actions

Once you've filtered the products, you can click the **Actions** menu to take the following bulk actions on them:

- Add/remove tags
- Publish
- Make Visible
- Make Hidden
- Duplicate
- Archive

### Add or remove tags

To add or remove multiple tags:

![](/assets/choose-remove-tags.png "Choose the Remove a tag option")
![](/assets/remove-tags.png "Remove a tag")

1. Filter products by CSV or select multiple products via checkboxes.
1. Click **Actions** and select **Add/Remove tags**
1. Type or select Tag names you'd like to add or remove from these products.
1. To add tags, click **Add tags to products**. To remove tags, click the arrow on the right, select **Remove tags from products** and then click **Remove tags from products**.
1. The tags should now be added or removed. To publish these changes, make sure to click **Actions** and select **Publish**.
