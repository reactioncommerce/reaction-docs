## Install

To install Reaction for development, testing, or demonstration on your own computer, follow these [Reaction Platform instructions](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-platform/tree/release-v3.0.0#prerequisites).

Read [Developing In Docker](installation-docker-development) to understand how to do development on a multi-service application like Reaction.

## Common Commands

Reaction Commerce is made up of multiple projects (services) that work together. In most NodeJS Reaction projects, the following commands will work.

> Before running commands on your computer, always run `nvm use` to be sure the correct version of NodeJS is used. You may want to install a shell plugin that does this automatically whenever you `cd` into a directory that contains a `.nvmrc` file.
