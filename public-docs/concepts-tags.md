title: Tags
---

Each shop can have a list of **tags**, which are just predefined words or phrases, and one or more of these tags can then be added to each product in that shop. Tags can be arranged into a **hierarchy**, and that hierarchy then becomes the browse menu for the shop in the user interface. This hierarchy is also reflected in the **breadcrumbs** that are shown on each product detail page.

Note the following:

- Tags are set on products, and not on variants
- In a marketplace setup, tags created in a primary shop are visible and available to all merchant shops.
