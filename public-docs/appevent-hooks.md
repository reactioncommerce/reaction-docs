title: App Events
---

The `Hooks.Events` API and `MethodHooks` from previous versions of Reaction have been removed in favor of `appEvents`. `appEvents`, like hooks, allow you to attach callbacks to particular events throughout the app lifecycle.

## Emit an app event

Emit app events in API code using `appEvents.emit`. The `emit` function takes at least two parameters: the name of the event as a string and the `payload` of functions as an object.

### Function parameters and options

- *Event name*: The first argument is the event name, as a string. There is currently no limit to what event name you can emit, but generally try to follow established patterns for naming. See events table below.
- *Payload*: The second argument, the `payload`, should always be an object, and not an entity object. Rather than passing `order` in directly, pass it in an object: `{ order }`, so that more fields can be added or removed from the payload more easily.
- *Option arguments*: The last argument is an array of arguments to pass to each function from `payload`.
- *Using `await`*: Using the method with `await` will not resolve until all of the registered handler methods have resolved.

## Emit an app event

```js
context.appEvents.emit("eventName", payload, options);
```

## Listen for an app event

See ["Run plugin code on app startup"](dev-how-do-i.md) and attach event listeners in startup code.

```js
// In startup function:
context.appEvents.on("eventName", (payload, options) => {
  // Handle the event
});
```

## Avoid infinite loops

It's possible to get stuck in an infinite loop of emitting and listening for the same event. To avoid this, pass `emittedBy` key with a string value in the third options parameter on the `emit`, and check for it on the `on` function:

```js
const EMITTED_BY_NAME = "myPluginHandler";

appEvents.on("afterCartUpdate", async ({ cart }, { emittedBy } = {}) => {
  if (emittedBy === EMITTED_BY_NAME) return; // short circuit infinite loops

  appEvents.emit("afterCartUpdate", { cart: updatedCart, updatedBy: userId }, { emittedBy: EMITTED_BY_NAME });
});
```

## Events

Events that are currently defined in Core and their previous Hooks-equivalents are:
