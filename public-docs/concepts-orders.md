During the checkout process, information and choices are collected from the shopper and saved on the cart. Once all necessary information is present on a cart, the shopper can complete checkout, at which point an **order** is created and the cart is deleted.

An order has much of the same information that its source cart had, but additionally tracks the process of fulfilling the order and completing the associated payments, as well as returns, taxes, and invoice information.

Orders can also be created directly from another system.
