Platitudes are cheap. We've all heard organizations say they're committed to "diversity" and "tolerance" without ever getting specific, so here's our stance on it:

We welcome you.

We welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race, skin color, ethnicity, age, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype, religion, elder status, family structure, culture, subculture, political opinion, education level, identity, and self-identification. We welcome activists, artists, bloggers, crafters, coders, wannabe-coders, designers, entrepreneurs, documentation writers, journalists, sys-admins, teachers, ordinary people, extraordinary people, and everyone in between.

We welcome you. You may wear a baby sling, hijab, a kippah, leather, an XXXL t-shirt, a pentacle, a political badge, a rainbow, a rosary, tattoos, or something we can only dream of. You may carry a guitar or walking cane or a 15 year old laptop. Conservative or liberal, libertarian or socialist — we believe it's possible for people of all viewpoints and persuasions to come together and learn from each other. We believe in the broad spectrum of individual and collective experience and in the inherent dignity of all people. We believe that amazing things happen when people from different worlds and world-views approach each other to create a conversation.

We get excited about web development — from professional to amateur, from giant projects to simple apps, from the coder who's been doing this since the day Reaction Commerce was conceived in Santa Monica, CA to the newbie who just started studying Reaction Commerce today.

We think accessibility for people with disabilities is a priority, not an afterthought. We think neurodiversity is a feature, not a bug. We believe in being inclusive, welcoming, and supportive of anyone who comes to us with good faith and the desire to build a community.

There are a few diversity initiatives in the Reaction Commerce community, but there can always be more. We protect our diversity through our Code of Conduct and the team that applies it. We also call on you, as a member of the Reaction Commerce community, to proudly show your support. Be generous, understanding and respectful to your fellow Reaction community members. Seek out newcomers and help them feel like they belong. Listen with empathy when someone has a different perspective. Talk to someone if you notice that something could be better.

We have enough experience to know that we won't get any of this perfect on the first try. But we have enough hope, energy, and idealism to want to learn things we don't know now. We may not be able to satisfy everyone, but we can certainly work to avoid excluding anyone. And we promise that if we get it wrong, we'll listen carefully and respectfully to you when you point it out to us, and we'll do our best to make good on our mistakes.

We think our technical experience is important, but we think our community experience is more important. We know what goes wrong when organizations say one thing and do another, or when they refuse to say anything at all. We believe that keeping Reaction Commerce transparent is just as important as keeping our servers stable.

We work with Reaction Commerce, and we invite everyone to contribute, to the core Reaction Commerce code, the ecosystem of Reaction Commerce packages, and the community.

Come build the future of commerce with us.
