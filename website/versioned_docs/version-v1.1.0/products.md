What you see, the customer sees. Create, edit, and remove products inline. It’s simple, straight-forward product management.

## Creating Products

To create a product, login to your dashboard and click on the plus (+), located on the top right.

You’ll be taken to your product page, where you'll have the ability to change your product's photo, price, and description, all in real-time.

You may edit your product title, subtitle, vendor name, and product description by clicking on each section and typing into the field. To upload a product photo, drop a file into the grey square on the left, or simply click "Drop files to upload."

If your shop is connected to social, you may customize your product's social sharing messaging by clicking on the pencil icon on the right of the product pricing.

You may also add product tags by clicking on the plus (+) button, located under the "Tags" section.

## Product Variants

Assign prices, item weight, quantity, colors, and other properties to your product. Product variants allow you to create different versions of the same base product. Perfect for products that come, for example, in multiple colors.

Every product comes filled with one variant. To create more, click the pencil icon, located under the Options section.

Here's what all the variants mean:

- Label - A description of your variant, which appears in the drop-down menu under the "Options" section.
- Weight - The weight of your item, which will help determine shipping costs.
- Price (MSRP) - The suggested retail price of your product.
- Price - The price that you're actually selling your product.
- Taxable - Check this box to automatically add tax to this item when purchased.
- Inventory tracking - Check this box if you'd like to track this item in your inventory.
- Deny when out of stock - If selected, customers will receive an error message when out of stock.

# Variants Options

Variant options provide a second layer of customization on top of each variant. For instance, in addition to carrying shirts in multiple colors, you may also want to carry multiple size options for each color. Use this flexible structure to customize your products however you like. The sky's the limit!

To add options to a variant, click on the plus (+) button to the right of the “Variant Options” section.

Each option allows you to customize the option name, label, price, and quantity, as well as add a set of images.

## Product Media

To add an image gallery to your product, simply drag and drop files from your computer onto the Variant Option gallery screen. You may also upload images using the "Drop file to upload” button.

Currently, only image file types are supported, but support for video, Google Drive, Dropbox, and more are in the works. See [Issue #50](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/50) and [Issue #69](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/69).

## Product Grid

By default, products are displayed in a grid layout. When logged in as an admin, you may drag and drop products to reorder them.

You may also arrange products based on how you manage your tags. Manage the display order of your products based on the order of your tags in your navigation.

NOTE: When new products are added, they are given the top position by default.

## Removing Products

To remove an entire product from your inventory, login to your product view and click on the trash can. Select yes to archive.
