All Reaction [configuration options](configuration.md) can be used with these deployment choices.

Reaction can be deployed as a [standard Node application](https://guide.meteor.com/deployment.html) or as a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/).

The Reaction core team recommends using Docker for deploying Reaction.

We recommend you deploy with at least **2GB of memory** for Node and Reaction to run well.
