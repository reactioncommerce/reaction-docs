The dashboard is your online store's central mainframe. It's where you manage your orders, add or remove products, install apps, and change your account settings. It's where the magic happens, more or less.

To access your dashboard, simply click on the blue Reaction logo icon, located on the very top right of the page.

You'll find a selection of dashboard features, broken down into two sections, Actions and Settings. In the Actions section, you’ll find important tasks that are used on a daily basis.
