## Customization Guide

Looking to customize your store? Check out our [customization guide](tutorial.md) for a walkthrough, as well as examples on how to create your own custom packages.

## Local Plugins

A number of plugin modules are imported in the `reaction` local `/imports/plugins` folder. We will refer to these local packages as "Core" packages, or as local plugin modules.

Below are some of the Reaction plugin modules that are included:

- reaction-accounts
- reaction-analytics
- reaction-analytics-libs
- reaction-collections
- reaction-core
- reaction-core-theme
- reaction-default-theme
- reaction-email-templates
- reaction-sample-data
- reaction-schemas
- reaction-social
- reaction-shipping
- reaction-ui

### Packages

The preferred method of extending Reaction functionality is to import local plugins or [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages.

Reaction is also able to install Meteor packages from [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/), Meteor's legacy package registry.

To further customize your experience, you can create or use community packages from npm and Atmosphere. For more info, [click here](https://guide.meteor.com/atmosphere-vs-npm.html).
