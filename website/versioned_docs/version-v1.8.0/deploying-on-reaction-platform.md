The following documentation is for the Reaction Platform.

The `reaction-cli` incorporates functionality for any team to deploy Reaction Commerce to multiple environments.

1. Get invite token from welcome email or contract
2. Register local environment
3. Create, add, and publish SSH keys
4. Create application environment
5. Deploy application

## Request invite token

As a paid user of the **Reaction Platform**, you'll receive an email containing a "invite token" from the Reaction Platform API ("Launchdock"). **Launchdock** is the name of our internal  orchestration management platform.

You will be asked for your invite token when you use the [reaction-cli](http://getrxn.io/reaction-cli) to register your local Reaction environment with the Reaction Platform API.

## Register local environment

### Update `reaction-cli`

Beforey you get started, make sure you have the latest version of the `reaction-cli` by running:

```sh
npm i -g reaction-cli
```

To confirm you have the latest version, run:

```sh
reaction -v
```

You should see the versions for `reaction-cli` and all of its dependencies:

```sh
$ reaction -v

Node: 8.2.1
NPM: 5.5.1
Meteor Node: 4.8.4
Meteor NPM: 4.6.1
Reaction CLI: 0.19.0
Docker: 17.09.0-ce
```

Now you're ready to get started.

### register

`reaction register` to create keys locally before configuring your application environment. `reaction login` authenticates you to the Reaction Platform and synchronizes platform services.

```sh
# Register with invite token
reaction register

# or if you've already registered, login with your username and password
reaction login
```

## apps

An "application" is an instance of Reaction Commerce plus any services, connectors, or container dependencies that are configured to deploy as one to an application environment.

```sh
#### apps list
# list your apps and their domains
reaction apps list
```

### create

Creating an "app" configures the environment that the built application will be deployed into.

```sh
# Create and configure your new app deployment
reaction apps create \
  --name <appname> \
  -e REACTION_USER="yourname" \
  -e REACTION_AUTH="P@s5w0rd" \
  -e REACTION_EMAIL="you@example.com" \
  --registry  path/to/reaction.json \
  --settings path/to/settings.json
```

### clone

Git clone a previously deployed app

```sh
# clone an app repo into ./my-app
reaction apps clone --app my-app

# clone an app repo to a custom path
reaction apps clone --app my-app --path ./optional/destination/path/
```

### delete

Deletes an application deployment.

```sh
# delete existing app deployment
reaction apps delete --name <appname>
```

## env

Configure environment variables for the application deployment.

```sh
# set/update environment variables
# (this triggers a redeploy of your app)
reaction env set \
  --app <appname> \
  -e SOME_API_KEY="ec89jmur3jim8e34" \
  -e SOME_OTHER_THING="dj8dr34ju3r@#$" \
  -e MAIL_URL="smtp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@NEW_HOST:PORT"

# unset environment variables
# (this triggers a redeploy of your app)
reaction env unset --app <appname> -e SOME_API_KEY -e SOME_OTHER_THING

# list your currently set environment variables
reaction env list --app <appname>
```

**--registry** pass a `reaction.json` to the environment

**--settings** pass a Meteor `settings.json` to the environment

## domains

```sh
# Add a custom domain for your app
# First, update your DNS to point your domain at: ingress.launchdock.io
# Once DNS has updated and works, set your custom domain for your app.
reaction domain set --app <appname> -d mycoolshop.com

# remove a custom domain from your app
reaction domain unset --app <appname> -d mycoolshop.com
```

## deploy

Submit your application for a deployment. This will begin the CI/CD/CD process. This begins a build process that is unique for every project. Expect this entire process to take around 20 minutes.

- test and build production bundle (continuous integration)
- build container image and publish (continuous delivery)
- deploy application cluster (continuous deployment)

```sh
# Deploy your application
reaction deploy --name <appname>
```

Expect to receive an email with the completed build status (failed or deployed).

## logs

To get all application logs since your app's last startup:

```sh
reaction logs --app <appname>
reaction logs -a <appname>
```

Hint: to get a list of all apps you have access to, run `reaction apps list`

### CI/CD Configuration

[Continuous integration configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) should be committed in [.reaction/ci/config.yml](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/blob/master/.reaction/ci/config.yml).

## Basic example

Below is an example `simple-demo` application deployment, setting the minimum required settings.

```sh
# create the application environment
reaction apps create --name simple-demo

# deploy application to the environment
reaction deploy --app simple-demo

# open your app in your browser once build/deployment has finished
reaction open simple-demo
```

## Full example

Below is a more complete example that sets up a SMTP mail server URL (for app emails), imports [Reaction registry](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/master/registry) settings and [Meteor settings](https://docs.meteor.com/api/core.html#Meteor-settings), and deploys the latest official Reaction Commerce image. Then we update the app with an API key environment variable.  And finally, we add a custom domain to the app and open it in our browser.

```sh
# create the app
reaction apps create \
  --name full-demo \
  -e REACTION_USER="yourname" \
  -e REACTION_AUTH="P@s5w0rd" \
  -e REACTION_EMAIL="you@example.com" \
  -e MAIL_URL="smtp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@NEW_HOST:PORT" \
  --registry  private/settings/reaction.json \
  --settings settings/settings.json

# deploy a Docker image
reaction deploy --app full-demo

# set/update an environment variable
reaction env set --app full-demo -e SOME_API_KEY="<secret API key>"

# add a custom domain
reaction domains add --app full-demo --domain mycoolshop.com

# list your apps to confirm your configuration, URL's, etc.
reaction apps list

# open your app in your browser
reaction open full-demo
```
