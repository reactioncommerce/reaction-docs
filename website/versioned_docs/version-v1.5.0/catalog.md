## What is catalog revision control?

Revision control in Reaction adds the ability for admin users to review, stage, and revert changes to products. When enabled, any changes to a product will be saved as a draft, with the original product remaining unchanged. Upon publishing changes to that draft, the publicly visibly product will then have those changes applied.

At the moment revision control is merely used to stage a single upcoming update.

## Enabling and disabling revision control

In the dashboard click <i class="font-icon fa fa-book"></i> **Catalog**, where you may toggle revision control `on`, or `off`.

Currently, turning off revision will give you the legacy version of the product detail page.
