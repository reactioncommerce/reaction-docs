These FAQs attempt to address common questions and concerns around the Reaction community's Code of Conduct. If you still have questions after reading, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:conduct@reactioncommerce.com).

## Why have you adopted a Code of Conduct?

We think the Reaction Commerce community is awesome. If you're familiar with the community, you'll probably notice that the Code basically matches what we already do. Think of this as documentation: we're taking implicit expectations about behavior and making them explicit.

We're doing this because the Reaction community is growing faster than any of us could have anticipated. On balance, it's a very positive thing, but as we've grown past the point where it's possible to know the whole community, we think it's very important to be clear about our values.

We already know that the Reaction community is open, friendly, and welcoming. Now, we want to make sure everyone else knows it too.

## What does it mean to "adopt" a Code of Conduct?

For the most part, we don't think it means large changes. We think that the text does a really good job describing the way the Reaction community already conducts itself. We expect that most people will continue to behave in the awesome way they have for years.

However, we do expect that people will abide by the spirit and words of the CoC when in "official" Reaction spaces. This code has been adopted by all members of the Reaction Commerce Team. This code will apply both in community spaces and at any Reaction events.

In practice, this means mailing lists, the Reaction chat channel, bug tracking and code review tools, and "official" Reaction events such as meetups and conferences. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

## What about events funded by Reaction?

This Code of Conduct also covers any events that Reaction Commerce coordinates or sponsors. We may decide to add a separate Code of Conduct for offline events.

This Code of Conduct is all about how we interact as a community. It's about saying that the Reaction community will be open, friendly, and welcoming. The core issue is about ensuring the conversations we have are productive and inviting for all.

Real-life events, however, may require a bit more care. The Reaction Commerce Team wants to be sure that any events it funds have policies and procedures in place for handling harassment. It's especially important to us that real-life events take steps to protect the physical and mental security of their participants.

Any event that we fund will have some sort of anti-harassment policy in place. The Reaction Commerce Team thinks the [Ada Initiative's template](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) is pretty good, but we're open to alternatives.

## What happens if someone violates the Code of Conduct?

Our intent is that the anyone in the community can stand up for this code, and direct people who're unaware to this document. If that doesn't work, or if you need more help, you can contact <mailto:conduct@reactioncommerce.com>. For more details please see our [Reporting Guidelines](reporting-guide.md).

## Why do we need a Code of Conduct? Everyone knows not to be a jerk

Sadly, not everyone knows this.

However, even if everyone was kind, compassionate, and familiar with codes of conduct, it would still be incumbent upon our community to publish our own written coda. Maintaining a code of conduct forces us to consider and articulate what kind of community we want to be, and serves as a constant reminder to put our best foot forward. But most importantly, it serves as a signpost for people looking to join our community. We want them to know that these values are important to us.

## This is censorship! I have the right to say whatever I want!

You do -- in your space. If you'd like to hang out in our spaces (as clarified above), we have some simple guidelines to follow. If you want, for example, to form a group where Reaction is discussed using language inappropriate for general channels, then go ahead! Nobody's stopping you. We respect your right to establish your own personal codes of conduct in the spaces that belong to you. However, we ask that you honor our Code of Conduct in our respective spaces.
