4.  You can change the layout template, product title permalink, subtitle, vendor, description and origin country from the sidebar's top **Product Settings** option.
5.  Click the **Publish** button on the top right to save Unpublished changes.

## Configuring your first variant

Assign prices, item weight, quantity, colors, and other properties to your product. Product variants allow you to create different versions of the same base product. Perfect for products that come, for example, in multiple colors.

Every product comes filled with one variant. To create more:

1.  Click the <i class="font-icon fa fa-pencil"></i> icon, located under the Options section.
2.  Fill out the following fields in the Edit Variant panel:

-   **Label** - A description of your variant, which appears in the drop-down menu under the "Options" section.
-   **Origin Country** - A drop-down menu of countries
-   **Weight** - The weight of your item, which will help determine shipping costs.
-   **MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price)** - The suggested retail price of your product.
-   **Price** - The price that you're actually selling your product.
-   **Width, Length, Height, Weight** - The size of your product
-   **Taxable** - Check this box to automatically add tax to this item when purchased. Add Tax Code and Tax Description for more options.
-   **Inventory tracking** - Check this box if you'd like to track this item in your inventory.
-   **Allow Backorder** - Allows customers to backorder the product.

3.  Click the **Publish** button on the top right to save Unpublished changes.

## Adding more product variant options

Variant options provide a second layer of customization on top of each variant. For instance, in addition to carrying shirts in multiple colors, you may also want to carry multiple size options for each color. Use this flexible structure to customize your products however you like. The sky's the limit!

## Adding product images

To add an image gallery to your product, drag and drop files from your computer the main Product page. You may also upload images using the "Drop file to upload” button under each Variant Option.

Currently, only image file types are supported, but support for video, Google Drive, Dropbox, and more are in the works. See [Issue #50](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/50) and [Issue #69](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/69).
