Tags provide an easy way to classify and search for product items by group. This is what we refer to as a hashtag taxonomy.

Reaction features two types of tags: product tags and navigation tags. Product tags help customers find what they’re looking for, while navigation tags organize these keywords by category.

## Product Tags

To assign a tag to a product, go to the product detail page by clicking on the product. Tags will then be located below the images section.

To create a new tag, click on the pencil icon, type in your tag, and hit enter to save. If the item is a t-shirt, for instance, you might want to tag it with relevant keywords, like short sleeve, cotton, crewneck, etc.

To delete a tag, click on the gray x:

To rearrange the order of a tag, click on the three horizontal lines icon, and simply drag and drop.

## Navigation Tags

To edit your shop's navigation tags, click on the “Add Tag” button in the top nav bar.

To create a new navigation tag, type your keyword into the “Add Tag” box and hit enter. Previously created tags may be auto-suggested for you. Be sure your product tag corresponds with a navigation tag. Otherwise, your product page will be empty.

When you're finished, click anywhere outside of the top nav bar, and you're done!
