## Custom rates

![](/assets/admin-dashboard-tax-custom-rates.png "Reaction Dashboard - Custom Tax Rate")

Reaction gives you the ability to assign different tax rates to different regions around the world. To get started, click on the round plus button:

You may customize your rates by region via the following:

- Country
- State / Province / Region
- Zip code

Enter your rate as a percentage into the **Rate** field. Then, click **Save Changes,** and your new custom rate should show up at the top. You may use the search box to filter your results.

Please note that if you delete a custom rate from the dashboard, shopping carts that already have the tax included will still have it.
