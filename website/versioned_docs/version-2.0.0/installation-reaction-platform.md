The Reaction Platform is the easiest way to run the entire suite of Reaction services at once, as of Reaction version 2.0. The Platform installs and runs the entire suite of Reaction services in these directories:

| Directory                                                                                  | Services                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| [`reaction`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction)                                 | GraphQL API, Meteor API, Classic UI, Mongo |
| [`reaction-hydra`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-hydra)                     | Authentication server, PostgreSQL          |
| [`example-storefront`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront) | Next.js storefront application             |

## Installation

1. Requirements:

- Install Docker and Docker Compose ([Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) | [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) | [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose))
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A GitHub account with a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/">configured SSH key</a>

##### Recommended settings for Docker for Mac, Windows and Linux
- Minimum 4GB of RAM and 4CPUs, for better performance allocate 4GB+ and 4CPUs+. For instructions visit the advanced section of the [Docker for Mac Getting Started guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/).

> **Windows**: Reaction Platform has not been fully tested on Windows at this time.

> **Linux**: Docker Compose is included when installing Docker on Mac and Windows, but will need to be installed separately on Linux.

2. Before you get started, make sure you are not running any applications on the default ports: `3000`, `4000`, `4444`, `4445`, `5555`, `5432`, and `27017`.

3. Clone [**Reaction Platform**](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-platform)

```sh
git clone git@github.com:reactioncommerce/reaction-platform.git
```

4. Now you're ready to install. Run this command to bootstrap and start all of the services:

```sh
cd reaction-platform
make
```

This process may take some time. The Platform is checking that dependencies are present, cloning the sub-projects from GitHub, downloading and building Docker images, and starting services.

By the end of the initial `make` process, you should see these log messages:

```sh
Successfully tagged example-storefront_web:latest
Running post-build hook script for example-storefront.
example-storefront post-build script invoked.
Recreating example-storefront_web_1 ... done
Running post-project-start hook script for example-storefront.
example-storefront post-project-start script invoked.
Running post-system-start hook script for reaction-hydra.
reaction-hydra post-system-start script invoked.

No post-system-start hook script for reaction. Skipping.
Running post-system-start hook script for example-storefront.
example-storefront post-system-start script invoked.
```

You can confirm that all of these containers have installed and are starting up by running:

```sh
docker ps
```
You should see a log of all running containers with names, ports and statuses:

```sh
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                      NAMES

```

5. As the various repositories are downloading and services are starting, check the logs by running `docker-compose logs -f` in the specific repository. For example, to display the `reaction` logs, run:

```sh
cd reaction
docker-compose logs -f
```

To display the `example-storefront` logs, run:

```sh
cd example-storefront
docker-compose logs -f
```

6. Once all of the services are running, the following will be accessible at these URLs:

| Directory: Service                                                                         | URL                                                           |

## Developing with Reaction Platform

Once you've bootstrapped the entire Reaction development in Docker, use `make start` to start all containers.

### Reaction Platform commands

Run these commands from the `reaction-platform` directory:

| Command                    | Description                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make`                     | Boostraps the entire Reaction development environment in Docker.                      |
| `make stop`                | Stops all containers.                                                                 |
| `make start`               | Starts all containers.                                                                |
| `make rm`                  | Removes all containers. Volumes are not removed.                                      |
| `make clean`               | Removes all containers, networks, and volumes. Any volume data will be lost.          |
| `make init-<project-name>` | Example: `make init-example-storefront`. Does clone/setup for a single project. |

### Git

Each sub-project has its own respective Git repository. If you want to run a different branch of `reaction` against `example-storefront`, for example, change directories into `reaction` and `git checkout` a different branch there.

### Environment variables

Most Reaction services need certain environment variables set properly before they will start. Each project has a `.env.example` file that is copied to a Git-ignored `.env` file by the project's pre-build script. In most cases, these should have the correct values for running locally by default, but it's a good idea to review them.

Later, when you pull new commits for a project or check out a different branch, the project may have changed requirements for environment variables. But your `.env` file will not update automatically because it is Git-ignored. Thus, it's a good idea after every pull or checkout to either rebuild the project or `cd` into the project folder and run the `bin/setup` script. (For the `reaction` project, the script is at `.reaction/scripts/setup` instead of `bin/setup` due to how Meteor works.) This script will copy missing environment variables from `.env.example` to `.env`. Alternatively, you can compare and update `.env` manually.
