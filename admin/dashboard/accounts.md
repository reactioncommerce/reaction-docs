# Accounts

The Accounts section is your gateway to all things related to your shop members and guests. Here, you may add members, configure merchant access, and customize guest logins.

Before getting started, make sure you are logged in as an operator and click the <i class="font-icon fa fa-users"></i> **Accounts** icon in the Dashboard sidebar.
