# Taxes

We've partnered up with [Avalara](https://www.avalara.com/) and [TaxCloud](https://taxcloud.net/), two of the top tax management services, to bring custom tax and sales tax calculations to all shop owners.

To enable custom taxes, or to link to your Avalara or TaxCloud account, click on the <i class="rui font-icon fa fa-university"></i> **Tax** card and toggle each feature on or off.

## Custom rates

Reaction gives you the ability to assign different tax rates to different regions around the world. To get started, click on the round plus button:

You may customize your rates by region via the following:

- Country
- State / Province / Region
- Zip code

Enter your rate as a percentage into the **Rate** field. Then, click **Save Changes,** and your new custom rate should show up at the top. You may use the search box to filter your results.

Please note that if you delete a custom rate from the dashboard, shopping carts that already have the tax included will still have it.

If you use [Avalara](https://www.avalara.com/) or [TaxCloud](https://taxcloud.net/) to find a matching rate, that rate will override any predefined custom rates.

## Avalara
