## Custom Rates

Custom tax rates can be defined for region, postal, country.

Deleting a rate from the custom taxes will not remove the tax from carts where the tax rate has already been calculated.

If a tax service is enabled as well, and finds a matching rate it will supercede any matching custom rates.
