# Products
What you see, the customer sees. Create, edit, and remove products inline— no separate admin panel required. It’s simple, straight product management.

## Creating Products
To create a product, login as an admin, click on your profile in the top right corner, then click "Add Product" in the dropdown menu.

## Editing Products
With Reaction Commerce, there aren't any admin panels. Your product view is the same as the customer’s, and it's all in real-time. Simply login, click on the product you wish to edit, and change any field.

## Product Variants
Product variants allow you to create different versions of the same base product. Assign different prices, item weight, quantity, colors, and other key properties. Perfect for when you carry multiple colors of the same shirt.

Every product comes filled with one variant. To create more, click the "Edit" icon next to the first variant, or double click anywhere on the variant bar.

Click the "Clone" icon (![](/assets/guide-icon-files.png "Reaction Commerce clone variant")), and a new variant will be created as a clone of the original.

From there, you may edit info, uplaod images, or add videos.

To remove a variant, open and click the "Delete" button.

# Variants Options
Variant options provide a second layer of customization on top of each variant. For instance, in addition to carrying shirts in multiple colors, you may also want to carry multiple size options for each color. Use this flexible structure to customize your products however you like. The sky's the limit!

To add options to a variant, click on the “Variant Options” button to the left of the “Clone” button.

Each option allows you to customize name, price, quantity, and a set of images. To add media from the gallery, simply highlight an option.

## Product Media
Add product images by selecting from the variant media gallery. Currently, only image file types are supported, but support for video, Google Drive, Dropbox, and more are in the works. See [Issue #50](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/50) and [Issue #69](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/69).

To add images to the gallery, click on a variant, and drag and drop files from your computer onto the gallery screen.

Once you have images/videos added to your gallery, simply drag and drop to change their position.

## Product Grid
By default, products are displayed in a grid layout. When logged in as an admin, you may drag and drop products to reorder them.

Your product images come in 3 default sizes. To increase or decrease the size of your product image, click on the + icon and cycle through the available sizes.

You may also arrange products based on how you manage your tags. Manage the display order of your products based on the order of your tags in your navigation.

NOTE: When new products are added, they are given the top position by default.
