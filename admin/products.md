# Products

What you see, the customer sees. With Reaction, you can create, edit, and remove products inline, no separate admin panel required. It’s just simple, straight product management.

## Creating Products

To create a product, login as an admin, click on your profile in the top right corner, then click "Add Product" in the dropdown menu.

You’ll be taken to your product page, where you may click into and edit the available fields, as well as add variants.

You may also clone an existing product by clicking on the Clone icon (![](/assets/guide-icon-files.png "Reaction Commerce clone product")) from the grid view.

See sections below for details on editing products.

Until you choose to make a product visible, it is hidden from the public by default. To make a product visible, click the “Make It Visible" link in the product detail view.

Once the product is set to be visible, a link appears at the top of the product, which you may use to change back to hidden at any time.

## Editing Products

There is no Reaction admin panel. Your product view is the same as the customer’s— just login, click on the product you wish to edit, and change any field.

## Removing Products

To remove an entire product, simply login and click the Delete icon (![](/assets/guide-icon-delete.png "Reaction Commerce delete product")) in the grid view. Learn more about removing single variants by checking out the Product Variant section below.

## Product Variants

Product variants allow you to create different versions of the same base product. Assign different pricing, weight, quantity, and other key information, like multiple colors of the same shirt.

Every product is filled with one variant. To create more, click the edit icon next to the first variant, or double click anywhere on the variant bar.

Click the Clone icon (![](/assets/guide-icon-files.png "Reaction Commerce clone variant")), and a new variant will be created as a clone of the original.

![](/assets/guide-products-createvariant.png "Reaction Commerce create variant")

From there, you may edit info, add images, or include videos.

To remove a variant, open it and simply click the delete button.

## Variants Options

Variant options provide a second layer of customization within each variant. Feature shirts in multiple colors, as well as multiple size options for each color. You can use this flexible structure to customize your products however you like.

To add options to a variant, click on the “Variant Options” button to the left of the “Clone” button.

Each option allows you to customize name, price, quantity, and a set of images. To add media from the gallery, simply highlight an option.

## Product Media

Add product images by selecting from the variant media gallery. Currently, only image file types are supported, but support for video, Google Drive, Dropbox and more are in the works. See [Issue #50](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/50) and [Issue #69](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/69).

To add images to the gallery, click on a variant, and drag and drop files from your computer to anywhere on the gallery screen.

You may also upload images using the "Drop file to upload” button.

Once you have images/videos added to your gallery, simply drag and drop to change their position.

## Product Grid

By default, products are displayed in a grid layout. When logged in as an admin, you may drag and drop products to reorder them.

![](/assets/guide-products-gridorder.png "Reaction Commerce drag and drop merchandising")

Your product images come in 3 default sizes. To increase or decrease the size of your product image, click on the + icon and cycle through the available sizes.

You may arrange products based on how you manage your tags. Manage the display order of your products based on the order of your tags in your navigation.

NOTE: When new products are added, they are given the top position by default.
