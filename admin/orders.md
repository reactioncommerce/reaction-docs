# Order processing

To view and process orders, login as an admin and click on your avatar in the upper right corner of your shop. From the dropdown menu, select "Orders." Or, select the "Orders" icon on the right side of the dashboard.

You can also access your orders by clicking on the "Orders" card on your dashboard.

Once you've accessed your orders, you'll see your orders arranged by stage. As you complete the required steps for each stage, the order will move along the pipeline.

Here is what your orders page looks like without any orders:

We will be adding details on how to process individual orders, refunds, and credits at a later date. Check back here for more info.
