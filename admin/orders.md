You can also access your Orders by navigating to your Dashboard and clicking on the "Orders" card on the Dashboard page.

From the Orders screen, you will see each of your orders arranged by stage. As you complete the required steps for each stage, the order will move along the pipeline.

This is what your Orders page looks like without any Orders.
