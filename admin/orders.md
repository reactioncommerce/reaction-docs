# Order processing

To view and process orders, login as an admin and click on your avatar in the upper right corner of your shop. From the dropdown menu, select Orders. Or, select the Orders icon from the right side of your screen.

You can also access your Orders by navigating to your Dashboard and clicking on the "Orders" card on the Dashboard page.

From the Orders screen, you will see each of your orders arranged by stage. As you complete the required steps for each stage, the order will move along the pipeline.

This is what your Orders page looks like without any Orders.
