# Reaction Commerce Community Guidelines

All Community Guidelines content is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

We want to keep the Reaction community awesome, growing and collaborative. We need your help to keep it that way. To help with this, we've come up with some general guidelines for the community as a whole:

- **Be nice:** Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members: no regional, racial, gender, or other abuse will be tolerated. We like nice people way better than mean ones!
- **Encourage diversity and participation:** Make everyone in our community feel welcome, regardless of their background and the extent of their contributions, and do everything possible to encourage participation in our community.
- **Keep it legal:** Basically, don't get us in trouble. Share only content that you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break the law.
- **Stay on topic:** Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people. Please consider this before you update. Also remember that nobody likes spam.
- **Don't send email (or Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) to the core team:** There's no need to send email to the Core Team to ask them to investigate an issue or to take a look at a pull request. Instead of sending an email, GitHub mentions should be used to ping the Core Team members to review a pull request, a proposal or an issue. If you arenâ€™t sure about something, you can ask in our [chat room](https://gitter.im/reactioncommerce/reaction).

## **Guideline violations**

The point of this section is not to find opportunities to punish people, but we do need a fair way to deal with people who are making our community suck.

1. **First occurrence:** We'll give you a friendly, but public reminder that the behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.
2. **Second occurrence:** We will send you a private message with a warning that any additional violations will result in removal from the community.
3. **Third occurrence:** Depending on the violation, we may need to block your account from participating in our community areas.

Notes:

- Obvious spammers are banned on first occurrence. If we don't do this, we'll have spam all over the place.
- Violations are usually forgiven after 6 months of good behavior, and we won't hold a grudge.
- People who commit minor infractions will get some education, rather than hammering them with the above process.
- The rules apply equally to everyone in the community, no matter how much you've contributed.
- Extreme violations of a threatening, abusive, destructive or illegal nature will be addressed immediately and are not subject to above process or forgiveness.
- If you ever witness or experience any abuse, and you want to report it directly to us, please contact [conduct@reactioncommerce.com](mailto:abuse@reactioncommerce.com) and we will investigate.
- Contact [conduct@reactioncommerce.com](mailto:abuse@reactioncommerce.com) to report abuse or appeal violations. In the case of appeals, we know that mistakes happen, and we'll work with you to come up with a fair solution if there has been a misunderstanding.
